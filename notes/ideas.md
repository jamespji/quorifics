# Quorifics - Idea Notes

Potential directions for future development:

1. **Micro-automation tools**
   - Small Python scripts that solve repetitive tasks.

2. **LLM workflow experiments**
   - Prompt templates
   - Agent logic tests
   - Evaluation approaches

3. **Utility patterns**
   - Data cleaning utilities
   - Logging helpers
   - Config loaders

These ideas are placeholders and will be refined as the project grows.
