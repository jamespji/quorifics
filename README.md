# Quorifics

Quorifics is an experimental playground for testing small ideas, code snippets, and prototypes related to:
- Python tooling
- Data processing experiments
- LLM / AI agent workflows
- Simple automation concepts

This repository is currently in exploration mode.  
More features and structured modules will be added as the ideas evolve.

## Project Goals (Work in Progress)
- Build small, modular experiments that can grow into standalone tools.
- Document interesting findings, patterns, or code utilities.
- Explore potential directions for lightweight automation or AI-assisted workflows.

## Status
Active exploration  
The project is being updated gradually as new ideas come in.
